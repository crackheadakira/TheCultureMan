# TheCultureMan

This is a bot I made as a personal project to learn JavaScript. I just opened up Notepad++ and started watching tutorials. I later switched to VS Code.
You can [invite](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=867010131745177621&permissions=274878164032&scope=bot) it to your server

## Can I use this?
Yes you can, crediting me is optional.

## Will you keep adding feautres?
I try to add features that I deem possible for my current skill level, but it's also mostly that I don't have any ideas of what features to add.
