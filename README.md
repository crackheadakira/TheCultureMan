# TheCultureMan

This is a bot I made as a personal project to learn JavaScript. I just opened up Notepad++ and started watching tutorials. I later switched to VS Code.

## Can I use this?
Yes you can, crediting me is optional.

## Will you keep adding feautres?
I try to add features that I deem possible for my current skill level, but it's also mostly that I don't have any ideas of what features to add.

## Command Categories
- Anilist
- Hentai
- General

## because i'm a dumbass, here's the .env file code
```
token=BOT TOKEN HERE
prefix=n.
mongoDB=mongodb://localhost:27017/mongodb_discord
anitoken=ANILIST TOKEN HERE
```
