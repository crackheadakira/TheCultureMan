# TheCultureMan

This is a bot I made as a personal project to learn JavaScript. I just opened up Notepad++ and started watching tutorials. I later switched to VS Code.

## Can I use this?
Yes you can, I'd like it if you credited me though. But you don't have to.

## Will you keep adding feautres?
I try to add features that I deem possible for my current skill level, but it's also mostly that I don't have many ideas of what features to add.

## Want to Do

- ~~n.random by tag~~ __DONE__
- ~~Anilist Support~~ __DONE__
- ~~Update bot to Discord.JS v13~~ __DONE__
